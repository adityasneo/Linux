Best Practice: make sure scripts always include following
Shebang: the indicator of shell used to run the script code on the first line of the script:
#!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/env bash to identify bash as the script interpreter
comment to explain what the script is doing
white lines to increase readability
different block of code to easily distinguish between parts of the script

script names are arbitrary
extensions are nit required but may be convenient for scripts users from non-Linux os
because of Linux$PATH restrictons,scripts cannot be executed from the current directory
~/bin to store script for personal use
/usr/local/bin for scripts that should be available for all users

chmod +x hello-world -- run a script as a separate program,you need to set the execute permission
ls -l hello-world
pwd
echo $PATH
echo $?

RUNNING THE SCRIPTS
if directory containing the script is not in $PATH run it using ./myscript
scripts can also be started as an argument to the shell in which case no execute permission and $PATH is needed:bash myscript
best practice:to avoid confusion,include a shebang on the first line of the script and put in the $PATH so that it can run as an individual program
