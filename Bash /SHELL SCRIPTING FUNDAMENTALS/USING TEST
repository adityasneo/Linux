test is foundation of many if statements
test performs as 
Expression tests-evaluate the binary outcome of an expression which is a logical test by itself
string tests-evaluate if a string is present or absent and compare one string to another
integer tests- compare integers which include operations like bigger than smaaler than
file tests- test all kind of properties of files
test used in conditional statements
test condition can written as [condition]

USING LOGICAL TESTS
logical tests are if then else written diff way
Logical AND:structure is a&&b b is executed when a is successful
Logical OR: structure is a||b b executed only if a is not successful
Logical operators can be embedded in if statements to test multiple conditions
if [-d$!]&&[-x$1]; echo $ is a directory and has execute;fi
if[-f/etc/hosts]
then
 echo file exists
fi
[-f/etc/hosts]&&file exists


TESTING WITH [ [] ]
regular test  can written as [condition]
enhanced version written as [[condition]]
[[condition]] bash internal offers features not offered by test
[[$VAR1=yes&&VAR@=red]] using a conditional statement within the test
[[1<2]] tests if 1 is smaller than 2
[[-e$B]] will test is $b exists.if $b is a file that contains spaces,using [[]] won't reqiure to use quotes
[[$var=img*&&($var=*.png || $var=*.jpg)]]&&echo$var starts with img and ends with .jpg or .png
