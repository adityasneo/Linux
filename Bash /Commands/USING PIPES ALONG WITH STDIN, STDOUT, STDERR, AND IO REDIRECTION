Piping the output of one command to another command, and redirecting the output of the second command to a file

ls | grep myfile > filelist.txt
 lists all the files and directories in the current directory, pipes the output to the grep command, which searches for the word 
"myfile", and redirects the output of grep to the filelist.txt file

Redirecting STDERR to STDOUT using pipes
ls/nofile 2>&1 | grep "No such file"
tries to list a file that does not exist, redirects the STDERR stream to the STDOUT stream using 2>&1, pipes the output to the 
grep command, which searches for the phrase "No such file", and displays the results on the terminal

Using pipes to concatenate two or more commands
ls | sort | uniq
lists all the files and directories in the current directory, pipes the output to the sort command, which sorts the list 
alphabetically, and pipes the output to the uniq command, which removes any duplicates
