IMPORTANCE OF BASH SCRIPTING FOR DEVOPS 
 Bash scripting is an essential skill for DevOps engineers as it enables them to automate tasks and manage infrastructure 
effectively. Bash scripting is a programming language used to write scripts that can automate tasks in the Unix/Linux operating 
systems.
 Importance of bash scripting in DevOps and its history:
1. Automation: Bash scripting enables DevOps engineers to automate tasks such as software deployment, configuration 
management, and system administration. This automation improves efficiency, reduces human error, and ensures consistency in 
the management of infrastructure.
2. Shell scripting: Bash is a shell scripting language that can interact with the operating system and execute commands. This makes
it a powerful tool for DevOps engineers who need to manage and configure servers and applications.
4. Open-source: Bash is an open-source tool, which means it is free to use and can be customized according to individual needs. 
This makes it an attractive tool for DevOps engineers who work in organizations of all sizes.
5. Portable: Bash scripts are portable, meaning they can be run on different operating systems without modification. This makes it 
easy for DevOps engineers to move scripts between different environments and manage infrastructure consistently.

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF BASH
 Bash (short for Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interface and scripting language used in many Unix-based operating 
systems. It is a powerful tool for interacting with a computer system and performing a wide range of tasks, from simple file 
management to complex system administration.
 Here are some key points to help understand the role of Bash:
1. Bash is the default shell for most Unix-based operating systems. When you open a terminal window on a Linux or macOS 
system, you are typically interacting with Bash.
2. Bash allows users to execute commands and scripts, making it a powerful tool for automation and system administration.
3. Bash is highly customizable, with many configuration options and the ability to create custom scripts and aliases.
4. Bash supports variables and functions, making it possible to create complex scripts that can take user input and perform a 
series of actions based on that input.
5. Bash is often used in conjunction with other command-line tools, such as grep, awk, and sed, to perform more complex 
operations on files and directories.
6. Bash can be used to create scripts that can be run automatically on a schedule or in response to specific events.
Overall, Bash plays a crucial role in the Unix-based computing ecosystem, allowing users to interact with and automate complex 
system operations. Its power and flexibility make it an essential tool for system administrators, developers, and anyone else who 
works with Unix-based operating system
