head command is used to display the first few lines of a text file. The basic syntax is as follows:
 head [options] [input_file]
where [options] is a list of options that modify the behavior of the command (e.g., how many lines to display), and [input_file] is the name of the file to be
displayed.
For example, suppose we have a file called data.txt that contains the following data:
 1,John,Doe,42
 2,Jane,Smith,35
 3,Bob,Johnson,27
 4,Alice,Williams,51
 5,Michael,Davis,45
To display the first three lines of the file, we can use the following command:
 head -n 3 data.txt
The output of the above command will be:
 1,John,Doe,42
 2,Jane,Smith,35
 3,Bob,Johnson,27

tail command is used to display the last few lines of a text file. The basic syntax is as follows:
 tail [options] [input_file]
where [options] is a list of options that modify the behavior of the command (e.g., how many lines to display), and [input_file] is the name of the file to be displayed.
For example, suppose we have a file called data.txt that contains the following data:
 1,John,Doe,42
 2,Jane,Smith,35
 3,Bob,Johnson,27
 4,Alice,Williams,51
 5,Michael,Davis,45
To display the last three lines of the file, we can use the following command:
 tail -n 3 data.txt
The output of the above command will be:
 3,Bob,Johnson,27
 4,Alice,Williams,51
 5,Michael,Davis,45
To continuously display the last few lines of a file as they are added to it (useful for monitoring log files), we can use the -f option:
 tail -f [input_file]
 where [input_file] is the name of the file to be monitored.
