tr is an external utility allows for translation of characters
echo hello | tr[a-z] [A-Z]
echo hello | tr[:lower:] [:upper:]
echo hello | tr[a-m] [n-z]
echo how are you | tr[:space:] '\t'
bash variables can modify case using ^^(uppercase) and ,,(lowercase)
colour=red;echo ${color^^}
color=BLUE;echo ${color,,}
