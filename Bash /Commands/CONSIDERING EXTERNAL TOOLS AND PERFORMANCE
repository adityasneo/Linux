best practice: try to avoid using external tools
type - to find out if tool is external or not
to measure performance use time myscript to measure the amount of time it takes to run a script with or without external tools
time ls
which ls
which time
/usr/bin/time ls
type time
type cd
time awk -F : '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd
time cut -d : -f 1/etc/passwd
